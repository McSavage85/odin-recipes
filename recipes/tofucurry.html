        <ul class="list-items">
            <li>400g firm tofu</li>
            <li>2 tbsp cornflour</li>
            <li>4 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>5 tbsp tikka or madras paste</li>
            <li>2 white onions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 tbsp tomato purée</li>
            <li>500g tomato passata</li>
            <li>200g creamed coconut</li>
            <li>15g coriander, roughly chopped (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="body-text">For the roti:</div>
        <ul class="list-items">
            <li>100g plain or wholemeal flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
            <li>1 tsp vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <u><b>Method</b></u><br>
        <ol class="list-items">
            <li>
                Heat the oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 8. Drain the tofu on 
                kitchen paper and slice in half horizontally, patting 
                it as you go to absorb as much moisture as possible. 
                Tear the tofu into chunks, tip into a bowl and toss to 
                coat in the cornflour, 1 tbsp of the vegetable oil and 
                ½ tsp salt. Spread out on a baking sheet and bake in 
                the oven for 25 mins.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using the same bowl, make the roti. Mix the flour, a 
                pinch of salt and the oil together with enough water 
                (about 65ml) to make a soft, not sticky, dough. Knead on 
                a floured surface for 3 mins, then cover and leave to 
                rest while you make the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the remaining 3 tbsp oil in a frying pan over a 
                medium heat and cook the tikka paste until fragrant, 
                about 1 min. Add the onions and cook for 4-5 mins, 
                adding a splash of water if needed to prevent any 
                sticking, then cover and cook until completely 
                softened (about 8-10 mins more), stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the tomato purée, passata and a pinch of salt. 
                Simmer for a further 5 mins before adding the creamed 
                coconut. Reduce the heat to low while you make the roti. 
                Loosen the sauce occasionally with a splash of water if 
                it’s starting to look too thick.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the roti mixture into four equal balls. Roll the 
                balls out on a floured surface using a floured rolling 
                pin until 2-3mm thick. Heat a dry frying pan until very 
                hot, then cook each roti for 1 min on each side until 
                charred in places. Wrap in a tea towel as they come off 
                the heat to keep them soft.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the tofu from the baking tray and stir into the 
                sauce to coat before sprinkling with coriander and 
                serving with the roti.
            </li>
        </ol>
